Constraints:
- I want full control over my blog (design, organization), while being able to add content  
- I am broke, thus i can't afford to rent a web server and must rely on github pages which doesn't allow any server side code to run on it (except for jekyll)
- Jekyll could suit me and is definitely , however it is pretty much straightforward (see http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and except for the layout of the page there is not much challenge left in terms of learning for me
